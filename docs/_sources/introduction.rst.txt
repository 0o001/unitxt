Introduction

Unitxt is a Python library for getting data prepared and ready for utilization. In one line of code, it preps a dataset or mixtures-of-datasets into an input-output format for training and evaluation. Our aspiration is to be simple, adaptable, and transparent. 

Unitxt builds on the principle of separation. Separation allows adding a dataset without knowing anything about the models using it. It allows for training without worrying about preprocessing, switching models without loading the data differently, and changing formats (instruction, ICL, etc.) without changing anything else.
